class Node:
    def __init__(self, state, cost, heuristic, parent=None):
        self.state = state
        self.cost = cost
        self.heuristic = heuristic
        self.parent = parent

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return (self.cost + self.heuristic) < (other.cost + other.heuristic)

def astar(start, goal, neighbors, heuristic):
    open_set = [Node(start, 0, heuristic(start))]
    closed_set = set()

    while open_set:
        current_node = heapq.heappop(open_set)

        if current_node.state == goal:
            return [current_node.state] + ([] if current_node.parent is None else astar(start, current_node.parent.state, neighbors, heuristic))

        closed_set.add(current_node.state)

        for neighbor in neighbors(current_node.state):
            if neighbor in closed_set:
                continue

            cost_to_neighbor = current_node.cost + 1
            heuristic_to_goal = heuristic(neighbor)
            total_cost = cost_to_neighbor + heuristic_to_goal

            neighbor_node = Node(neighbor, cost_to_neighbor, heuristic_to_goal, current_node)

            if neighbor_node not in open_set:
                heapq.heappush(open_set, neighbor_node)

    return []  # No path found

# Example usage:
start_node = (0, 0)
goal_node = (4, 4)

def neighbors(node):
    x, y = node
    return [(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)]

def heuristic(node):

path = astar(start_node, goal_node, neighbors, heuristic)
print("Shortest path:", path)

Approach: 

1. Initialization:
   First The A* algorithm initializes an open set using a priority queue and a closed set as empty, starting from the given start node.

2. Exploration and Evaluation:
  We see  In each iteration, it selects the node with the lowest total cost (cost + heuristic) from the open set,  expands its neighbors, and evaluates their costs and heuristics.

3. Goal Check and Path Reconstruction:
   If the goal state is reached, the algorithm reconstructs and returns the path from the start to the goal.      Otherwise, it continues until the open set is empty.
