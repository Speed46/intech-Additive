d)Count Ways to Express a Number as the Sum of Consecutive Natural Numbers
Given a natural number n, we are asked to find the total number of ways to express n as the sum of consecutive natural numbers


def count_ways_to_express(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1

    while i <= n // 2:
        j = i
        total = 0

        while total < n:
            total += j
            j += 1

        if total == n:
            count += 1

        i += 1

    return count

# Example usage:
input_number = 15
result = count_ways_to_express(input_number)

print(f"The number of ways to express {input_number} is: {result}")
